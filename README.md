# IBM Data Science Capstone Project
This repository demonstrates the results from the course Applied Data Science Capstone offered by IBM on coursera. The notebooks leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities.

IBM credited a [digital badge](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/a0ed4e89-ec26-41f5-a8f0-c1c0b8eda1a7) after successfully completing the capstone project.
